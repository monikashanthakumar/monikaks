When it comes to street food options, the ever-so-delectable aloo tikki and aloo chaat definitely tops the charts. These two legendary street food snacks are loved by people across the country and have a variety of versions as well. Bite-sized pieces of potatoes tossed in a combination of tamarind and coriander chutney taste immensely good. Whereas, aloo tikki tastes the best when stuffed with a filling of moong dal along with a melange of Indian spices. Another seasonal chaat speciality is that of shakarkandi (sweet potato), which is available only during the bone-chilling months. Prepared by mixing bite-sized pieces of shakarkandi in a spicy masala mix, this winter street food is sure to make you crave for more.
